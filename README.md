#####   GENERAL INFO
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are time series data collected from the human scalp. An EEG is made up of multiple time series data, each corresponding to an electrode that is placed on the scalp. EEG signals can be collected rather quickly and represent the brain activity of the subjects under investigation. Within the context of the following projects, a dataset containing EEG recordings from healthy subjects and patients with chronic backpain, chronic widespread pain, joint pain, and neuropathic pain is provided from the University Hospital rechts der Isar. The aim of this project is to distinguish healthy subjects from patients by exploiting time series data collected from the human brain.

#####   SELF-SUPERVISED LEARNING ON EEG
Apply self-supervised architectures together with transfer learning techniques to build a model that performs classification based on the subject’s EEG data.

#####   MULTI-MODAL LEARNING ON EEG AND TABULAR DATA
Apply multi-modal deep learning techniques that leverage the subject’s EEG data together with the subject’s tabular data (demographic information, disease relevant information) to perform classification.
